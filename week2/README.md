## The Drones website
**In this project I had to build on an existing project. It was my job to make it responsive and look organised on various devices.** <br>
<br>
  Some of the challeges where:
- It was not allowed to change the HTML.
- It was mandatory to use **floats** in the first half of the website. <br>
