How do I create a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?
.<filename>     // adding a . in front of a file name will make it hidden.
ls -a           // adding -a to a ls command will list all files including hidden ones.

How do I create multiple nested directories, like /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun?
mkdir -p        // adding -p to mkdir, followed by the folders names will create nested directories.

How do I append a message to a file, without a newline character?
echo -e, \n, >> [filename.txt] // echo -e "this is a new line \nthis is another new line" >> file.txt
